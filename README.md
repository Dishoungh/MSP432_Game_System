# MSP432_Game_System
Code to turn the Texas Instruments MSP432 and Education Booster pack into a mini game system

This code was written in the Texas Instruments IDE "Code Composer" and compiled inside of it with gcc.
I have not tried to compile or push this code onto the MSP432 in any other way than with gcc and Code Composer.

# Project Operation
When the program is running the LCD will first display "press button." 
Once a button is pressed the user will be directed to choose what game they want to play.
Once the user has selected what game they want to play they will enter that game.
Once the game has finished the user will be directed back to the original "press button" screen.
