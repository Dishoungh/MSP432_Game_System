# MSP432_Game_System
Code to turn the Texas Instruments MSP432 and Education Booster pack into a mini game system

This code was written in the Texas Instruments IDE "Code Composer" and compiled inside of it with gcc.
I have not tried to compile or push this code onto the MSP432 in any other way than with gcc and Code Composer.
